# Brute-Force Sorting

I went online and got an algorithm for finding the next permutation in a list. This was gotten from chatGPT, I then interpreted the algorithm and wrote the code for it.

We talked about the complexity of the sorting problem, and used an argument over
all permutations of a list to be sorted to determine its complexity. Implement
a function to sort a list by systematically trying all permutations of the input
list, using the template in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

The return value should be the number of permutations that were tried until the
sorted list was "discovered". The unsorted list passed as an argument should be
sorted, i.e. do not copy the list and sort the copy.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the runtime complexity of the algorithm that you implemented? What does
a best case input for your implementation look like, what does a worst case
input look like? How would this complexity change if you generated permutations
randomly without memory instead of systematically trying them?

The runtime complexity of the algorithm is N!, this is because you will run through every permutation
of the list at worst case and N!/2 on average case which is still N!. The best case for me would be a 
list that is already sorted because it would pass the first test to see if it is sorted. The worst case
